    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mo, a graphic designer with a passion for creativity and problem-solving. I specialize in illustration, and UI/UX, with a strong foundation in both aesthetics and functionality. My journey began with an undergrad degree in Psychology and Business Administration from Simon Fraser University, which has given me a unique perspective on understanding user behavior and crafting design solutions that resonate on both a personal and strategic level.</p>

<p>Since completing my <a href=#education>degree</a>, I've explored a variety of interests, from working in the Hollywood North film industry to studying aviation and contributing to nonprofit work. These experiences have broadened my creative approach and reinforced my belief in the power of design to tell meaningful stories and drive positive change.</p>

<p>If I'm not designing, you'll likely find me weightlifting or exploring new ways to express myself creatively. I'm deeply passionate about philanthropy and using my skills to make a difference in the world, both through professional projects and personal initiatives.</p>

<p>Design is not just a job for me - it's a way to connect, inspire, and make the world a little more beautiful and functional.</p>
